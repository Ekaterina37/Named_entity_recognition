# Named_entity_recognition
My project helps detect named entities in the text. Named entities include locations, names, organizations.
Finding names entities in text is the first step towards anonymization of text to use in research later, connect documents related by place or person, perform OSINT etc.
For instance, we can remove all names from transcripts of customer calls and study what went wrong durin the call (why the customer wasn't satisfied) without disclosing their personal information.
Or we can prepare medical records to be safely used by researchers.
Named entity recognition is crucial for a lot of applications related to sensitive data usage. It allows to levergae the power of data while observing the privacy regulations.

Model was built with Tensorflow.
